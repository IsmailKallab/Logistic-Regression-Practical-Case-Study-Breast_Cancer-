## Logistic Regression Practical Case Study: Breast Cancer

This repository contains a practical case study on using logistic regression for breast cancer classification.

### Overview
Logistic regression is a popular statistical method for binary classification problems. In this case study, we explore its application in predicting breast cancer based on certain features extracted from diagnostic images and patient data.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this study is sourced from [insert dataset source/link]. It comprises a collection of breast cancer samples with various features such as tumor size, shape, texture, and patient demographics.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a logistic regression model that can accurately classify breast cancer cases based on the provided features.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Exploratory data analysis and preprocessing steps including data cleaning, feature selection, and normalization.
2. **Model Development**: Building a logistic regression model using appropriate libraries or frameworks (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow).
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
